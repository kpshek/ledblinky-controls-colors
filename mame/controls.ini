miscDetails=IMPORTANT NOTE:  This game has several options regarding the control type.  It has an optional brake pedal/button as well as the option to play the game with either a 270 wheel or an 8way joystick.  The controls shown here are the ones used on the dedicated model.  Notice the lack of the brake pedal.  It seems that the brake pedal was used in conversion kits as the dedicated cabinet didn't have one.

miscDetails=This is a bootleg pcb that contains many classic vertical arcade games.  Because of this the 'alternating play' flag is invalid and will vary from game to game.  The game kit is a pcb only and thus lacks any official labels.  The manual for this version lists the buttons as 1P-S1 thru 2P-S3.  However, these are simply the jamma pinouts.  Every control panel overlay manufacturer that has since released a overlay for this unit has either left the labels blank or labeled them A, B and C respectively.

miscDetails=OTHER: The 720 controller is unique.  It is an optical sensed spinner with a joystick handle.  The controller had two encoder wheels on the same axis; one was like a normal spinner encode wheel with 72 spokes & 72 gaps, the other encoder wheel had only two gaps spaced as far as alternating gaps on the normal encoder wheel (ie: instead of gap, spoke, gap, spoke, gap like on the normal wheel, the middle gap was part of the one fat spoke seperating the two gaps on the ends).  The normal encoder wheel turns the character in the game, the other encoder wheel is to help keep the stick calibrated with the screen, on each rotation of the stick. Mame only emulates the normal wheel as a dial type input; the other is ignored.  The character in the game can face 16 directions: the 4 cardinal directions, the 4 normal diagonals, and the 8 directions inbetween the cardinals and the diagonals.  The Kick button makes the character skate faster (in case that's not clear).  Both buttons are mirrored on opposite sides of the 'joystick' spinner, but like most mirror cases, they are wired as a total of only two buttons.

miscDetails=This game uses a dedicated platform shaped like a pair of skiis.  It basically acts like a giant analog stick. The player navigates via three, lighted, navigational buttons. (Left, Right and Decision)  The Decision button also changes view during gameplay.  The 'sweep' and 'edge' descriptions were taken directly from the game's cryptic i/o test menu.  Knowing nothing about skiiing, the way the terms 'sweep' and 'edge' were used may be incorrect.

miscDetails=The cpo depicted a simple arrow pointing up for the button label.  Upon research I found that this button makes you go down the hill faster.  I modified the caption accordingly to avoid confusion.  For left and right, the cpo shows a picture of a skiier going left and right respectively.  I added the 'ski' part of the caption to prepare for the upcoming icon support in the viewer.  As the game doesn't have a true caption, this shouldn't be any less accurate.

miscDetails=Mame-wise, this game is really odd.  The original game uses dual 4-way trigger sticks.  However the author of the mame driver also hacked in an optional 1 stick control scheme so you can play the game with a regular single stick.  Unfortunately, this hack interferes with the real inputs so you have to clear one or the other to play properly.  It should also be noted that you can not rapid roll with the hack as the game requires you to press both sticks left or right at once to do a roll.  Also there is a phantom button defined that is useless.    Gameplay Tips:  To rapid roll push both sticks in the same direction.  (Left or right only)  To launch a grenade push both sticks to the outside and fire when ready.

miscDetails=This game uses a musical 'keyboard' and Turntable.  The keyboard is actually 5 trivia buttons rotated 90 degrees, arranged like a section of a piano.    Important NOTE:    This game has a 6th button next to the start buttons on the control panel labeled 'Effector'.  The button is mapped to start3 in mame because of it's physical position and this seems to make the most sense.   As the button doesn't really impact gameplay, we'll simply ignore it for now.

miscDetails=Original game has 2 pressure sensitive buttons but mame is hacked to 4 buttons.  To do the hard attack, press buttons 1 and 2 together, for high jump, press buttons 3 and 4 together.  Taken from the driver (namcos1.c)   Notes: The berabohm buttons don't work too well. The real thing has a special pressure sensitive button, with two switches. The harder you push the button, the faster the two switches are closed one after another. Due to MAME's limited input sample rate (once per frame) it is difficult to measure the time between the two.  Buttons (pressure sensitive) each button has two switches: the first is closed as soon as the button is pressed, the second a little later, depending on how hard the button is pressed. 	bits 0-5 control strength (0x00 = max 0x3f = min) 	bit 6 indicates the button is pressed 	bit 7 is not actually read by the game but I use it to simulate the second switch

It was so bad that Stern recalled the orignal joystick and offered free leaf replacments to all the owners.  So for the history books this game didn't use a regular 8 way, but in actuality it did 99 percent of the time.

miscDetails=I've made an executive decision on this one.  Since it's a prototype and there aren't any good pics of the control panel, I've decided to list the labels given in mame (which are not correct) and describe how the actual machine worked.  First off we have a yoke designed for this military conversion.  If not for this game, there wouldn't be a star wars yoke. The range of the shot was controlled by an analog dial on the bezel.  Next to that was a digital knob that controlled the magnification.  The game originally had a toggle switch that doesn't seem to be included in mame. My guess is that it was never hooked up to anything (this prototype was a mess and was never finished).  Please note that all buttons save the first hae hard-coded mappings.

Two immovable trigger sticks are mounted on a panel attached to the monitor.  When you try to move the sticks, they remain rigid and actually tilt the monitor!  The gameplay screen then scrolls depending upon where you tilt the monitor to.  This gives the illusion of the player looking through a window onto the battle field.

miscDetails=The buttons are arranged in a triangle, with fire on the bottom left corner, duck on the bottom right, and jump/start on the middle top corner.  The original analog stick used Hall Effect sensors instead of POTs.  Due to the price (and now out of production) of the sensors, many arcade operators replaced the hall effect sensors with their equivalent POT.  This game is very hard to control in mame with 8-ways or keyboards.  An analog joystick, OTOH, gives the player control like the original joystick.

miscDetails=OTHER: The 8-way trigger stick also can be rotated left or right.  (Label 'Rotate Left', and 'Rotate Right')  The rotation is analog, while the rest of the stick is a digital 8-way trigger stick.  Mame uses the DIAL type for this input.  Mame by default maps the rotate left & right to the same inputs as move left and move right, and the game plays fairly well with this setup.  To fire, you are supposed to move all the way to your side, press the fire button, and control the direction you shoot by rotating the trigger stick and moving it up and down.  As long as you hold the fire button, you can't move away from the edge.   NOTE: This entry has been modified to use a rotary optical joystick with a top fire button.  This is the closest to the controls the game originally had, unfortunately a top fire rotary does not exist.  You could, however, take a top fire handle and mount it into a rotary base, in theory at least.   There is a cheat that lets you shoot all the time (making the 'fire/grab' button just a fire button).

miscDetails=This game works exactly like crazy climber except you can shoot by pressing right on the left joystick and left on the right joystick at the same time.  Some conversion kits used top-fire joysticks as this is a rather un-natural movement for firing rapidly.  Because of this an auxillary input for 'fire' is included. So you can play this game with two joysticks, a joystick and a top-fire, two top-fires or whatever floats your boat.

miscDetails=In this game the player 2 control panel is behind player 1.  Yes I said behind.  On a real fire truck there are two steering wheels.  One is in the back of the truck and turns the read wheels independantly of the front, thus allowing for tight turns with such a long vehicle.  This game is played exactly the same with player 2 controlling the rear wheel when two player mode is selected.  When 1 player mode is selected, those rear controls are ignored and thus the game is much harder to play.

The players can buy power-ups; when they get a shooting power-up the character gets a floating shooting platform that rotates with the player.   When the spinner is not pressed and is rotated, the platform rotates around the charcter, staying relative to the direction the character is facing.   When the spinner is pressed and rotated, the platform and character rotate at their own centers.

miscDetails=It really was a three way joystick, basically a 4-way stick without a down.  The button flicked out your frog's tongue. *update*    I looked into this.  This game was generally hacked into an old frogger cab.  The jump button was hacked into the 4way up and a tongue button was added.  However mame uses a two way joystick and two buttons to emulate the hardware (which is correct input wise) so we reflect these constants in the database.  As it's sorta a bootleg there isn't much point in worrying about control accuracy.

miscDetails=This game, along with Wild Western and Tin Star, used a unique controller.  The Actual game uses a '8 way push to fire' spinner.  The 'spinner' actually used a cam to engage one or two of the 4 microswitches below the control panel.  So if you have a real spinner then don't expect to use it with this game. MAME emulates this like a dual 8-way joystick game.  This set-up works well for the original controls, but poorly for anything else.  Note: Spinners and rotary joysticks can not be used in MAME for this game.  In the tank stages, use grenades to enter the blue tank.  Exit the tank when it is hit.  Use the spinner to rotate and fire the tank turret.

miscDetails=Grenade button also gets you into and out of the tank.  Used the SNK LS-30, 12 direction rotary, but only faces 8 directions in the game.  Usually the buttons were mirrored on both sides of the joystick for a total of four physical buttons per player, but both fire buttons and both grenade buttons are wired to the same PCB input.  The recommended button colors are yellow for the fire button, and black for the grenade button.  To enter test mode hold down the service key (F2) during boot or reboot until grid screen; press service button to go to next test screen; reboot to exit.   Mame's driver has an extra 13th 'direction' between 5 & 6 because it 'avoids the 'joystick error' protection in Guerilla War which happens when direction changes directly from 0x50&lt;-&gt;0x60 8 times.'

miscDetails=The Hyper Neogeo 64 system was the next generation of the classic neogeo mvs system. This new system wasn't as popular and only had a few games released on it.   They all used the same control layout and relied upon inserts to explain to the consumer what button was what. Also 99% of the games started with a 'How to Play' screen upon starting the game.  Although these games don't work yet in mame, the inputs are already hooked up, just like the original neogeo.  It would be silly to think that these would be altered after the driver is in working order.

The two fire buttons were mirrored, one on each side of the small panel, one panels of there own, angled sideways at about 30 degrees from vertical.  The two start buttons were the Atari cones on their own panel above the small panel of the joystick.  Mame has two seperate buttons emulated, but the second does not do anything.  The test screen only lists one fire button, so it looks like the two physical fire buttons were wired together in the original game, connected to the PCBs as one.  The original joystick was a Hall Effect joystick: an analog joystick that used magnetics to vary the resistance instead of the usual POT.

miscDetails=Like some other Atari games, such as Road Runner & Peter Packrat, the player start buttons double as the action buttons.  The original game has the Whip button mirrored on both sides of the joystick. The left side Whip button is also 1 player start button; mame emulates this as two buttons, button1 and start1. The right side Whip button is also the 2 players start button; mame emulates this as only the 'start2' button, even though pressing mame's start2 button also whips the whip.  Also, the buttons are used to select the number of lives the player has: the right selects the normal 3 lives (1 credit), the left selects 7 lives (for 2 credits).

These inputs are actually wired to the controls on the right side of the panel.  These controls are a 4 way jostick and a button (gas).  This seems like a huge waste of control space, but I suppose at the time, generic panels seemed silly.

The game refers the players as 'Red Player', 'Yellow Player', 'Blue Player', not 'Player 1', etc.  There are also two player cabs of this game, but all they did was remove the Yellow car's inputs, including the coin inputs.  There are no dipswitches to change.  So on these cabs, the 'second player' is the blue car, but all the inputs are connected to what is still 'Player 3' in mame.  To eneter service mode, hold down Blue Nitro button and press service button.  The menus are scrolled down by pressing the Red Nitro button, and selected by pressing the Blue Nitro button.

miscDetails=There are no Start buttons; the Nitro buttons double as the Start buttons.  You also use the the Nitro buttons to select improvements on your car.  There are two Nitro buttons for each player, mirrored on each side of the steering wheel, but they are wired together as one button in the harness.  'Player 1' is the Red car or 'Red Player', 'Player 2' is the Yellow car or 'Yellow Player', and 'Player 3' is the Blue car or 'Blue Player'.  The game and manual refer to the players with their color, not a number.  Might be because of next point.  There are also two player cabs of this game, but all they did was remove the Yellow car's inputs, including the coin inputs.  There are no dipswitches to change.  So on these cabs, the 'second player' is the blue car, but all the inputs are connected to what is still 'Player 3' in mame.  This was usually done not because of blue being a more popular color, but the arcade operators need the blue nitro button to change game settings.  To eneter service mode, hold down Blue Nitro button and press service button.  The menus are scrolled down by pressing the Red Nitro button, and selected by pressing the Blue Nitro button.  This is basically the same as the original Ironman Ivan Stewart's Super Off Road.  However, it has new tracks, and the players can choose between driving a dune buggy or the original truck.  The control is exactly the same.

miscDetails=The start button is labeled 'Join'.  Player 1 is 'left QB', player 2 is 'left HB', and are on the same team.  Player 3 is 'right QB', player 4 is 'right HB', and are on the same team.  The CP has the players from left to right: LHB, LQB, RQB, RHB, or if you go by numbers, 2, 1, 3, 4.  Only the quarterbacks have springsticks (to control throwing & kicking), but all players have a normal 8-way stick to control the player's movements.  The action button does different things, depending on what the 8 way stick is doing.  Since the 2 & 4 players don't have a spring stick, they often have the action button mirrored on both sides of the joystick. The analog joystick 'springsticks' were held all the way up by the spring, with free movement sideways. The farther back you pulled the springstick, the farther/faster you would throw or kick the ball when you released the stick.  The label 'short' is positioned just below the springstick, below which is 'long'.  Along with the words, part of the label is a fat pointed line or arrow, pointing down away from the springstick.

These joysticks don\'t have any labels and merely have arrow directions printed on the overlay.  The left joystick controls movement while the right determines the type of attack.  Different attack directions while in different positions perform different moves.  Luckily, the game tutors you on moves during the first round.    It should be noted that this game comes in one and two player versions.

miscDetails=OTHER: Mame's driver (incorrectly) emulates this as an 8way trigger stick (so I included that).  However, the real game used an analog trigger joystick (so I put other).   The A/D circuit in part of the joystick assembly, instead of on the main PCB or daughter board like most analog joysticks; and the connection had 8 pins per axis.   The joystick handle looked a lot like (if not exactly the same as) a tron handle.  The spinner was also a push down button, much like a Forgotten Worlds spinner.

miscDetails=Mame uses the jamma standard for button numbering and thus all of the mk games are completely off. The games buttons were arranged in a cross pattern with block the center of the 'X' high and low punch on the left and high and low kick on the right respectively. It is highly reccomended that you write ctrlr files for these games if you intend to play them. Also there is actually a second block button used for sf2 conversions but it alternates between broken and half working in the mame source.

There is also a global start button that starts the race without giving others time to join.  This is mapped to player 1 start in mame.

There was a single game version, a 2 game, 4 game, and 6, game version. The multi-cart versions had buttons to switch to a new game prior to inserting your quarter.  As of this writing, this feature is unemulated in MAME.   They all used the same control layout and relied upon inserts to explain to the consumer what button was what. Also 99% of the neogeo games started with a 'How to Play' screen upon starting the game.

miscDetails=OTHER:  There is a dipswitch to use either two 49-way or two 8-way joysticks for direction control.  AFAIK, all blitz dedicated cabs came with 49-way stick; some upgrade kits came with 49-way sticks, others without any sticks (I guess assumed operator would use already installed 8-ways).  Mame currently (0.82u3) only emulates the 8-way.  In-game instructions sometimes refer to the buttons by their color instead of the label.  Turbo = White, Jump = Blue, Pass = Red.  When choosing the offensive play: the Turbo (White) button switches between the two pages of plays, Jump (Blue) flips the play directions left to right, and Pass (Red) chooses the highlighted play.  When choosing the defensive play: any button chooses the highlighted play (only one page, and plays can't be flipped).  When choosing either offense and defense you can turn off showing which play is highlighted by pressing up on the joystick three times (useful when playing against another player).  Turbo + Pass when running with the ball gives a stiff arm.  Tapping Turbo twice when running with the ball gives a spin.

miscDetails=OTHER: This game used a 49-way joystick.  This game was recently updated to accomidate true analog inputs to better emulate the 49-way joystick.  Unfortunately, they turned an othewise tidy driver into an ungodly mess.  The stick is there and oddly enough three joystick directions (up, down, and only left) and now the normal 'button 1' labels are overwritten with the game selection labels, which are secondary functions and should NOT be the custom labels for the buttons.    For the love of all things good, someone PLEASE fix this driver.  The joystick controls one player, but when you punch, the rest of the team also punches.  If another teammate has the ball and you press the pass button, he passes the ball to you.  If you have the ball and press and hold the pass button, the choices rolls between long, short, back passes, and a drop kick, which happens when you let go of the button.

miscDetails=The cpo lables are a little misleading.  By 'Start' it actually refers to launching the pinball, not the start button, which the game actually has two of.  Also, although there are two buttons on each side Labeled 'Start And Shake' apparently, only the left button starts and only the right button shakes.  This may be a mame issue though.  My best guess is on the original cpo, each button was cross-wired to both switches as a last-minute layout decision.

miscDetails=Although in the arcades the start buton was also the jump button, this is not the case in mame.  My guess is in the arcades two inputs were wired to the same button to save space much like in other 3 and 4 player games.  This game only had a 2 player verison in japan, but often the 3 player us version was also used in a 2 player cabinet because of the way the menu is setup.  Unlike most multiplayer games, the coin slots are shared and you can select each character regardless of which stick you press start at.

The game has the fire and force buttons on both sides of the joystick, but not 'mirrored': the force is to the left of the fire button on both sides of the joystick.  NOTE  In Mame this game actually has four buttons.  This is due to some sloppy code and nothing more.  The dipswitches between this game and a similar game running on the same system were identical, so the input function was simply re-routed to that game.  This needs to be removed asap.

There are three basic different CP layouts for this game: 3 player trackball, 2 player trackball (dipswitch with same ROM as 3 player TB), and 2 player 8-way joystick (with ramprt2p and rampartj).  The 3 player dedicated TB CP had two buttons per player on the left side of the TB.  The kit highly recomends mirroring the buttons on both sides the joystick, with two buttons wired to each button input, but this was not always followed.    Button2 (Rotate Peice/Fire) is labeled as the 3 player TB CP; for the joystick CP, this button was 'Rotate Piece/Speed Up' instead to give the joystick two movement speeds in the shooting part of the game.

miscDetails=The action buttons are 'mirrored' on both sides of the trackball like normal, and double as start buttons.  However, the start half of the buttons are not mirrored: the start buttons go 1 2 1 2 from left to right, and the left side start buttons give you 3 ships for one credit, while the right side buttons give you 7 ships for two credits.  So the layout, from left to right, is (energy / 1 player with 3 ships), (decoy / 2 players with 3 ships each), trackball, (decoy / 1 player with 7 ships), (energy / 2 players with 7 ships each).  Mame's emulated buttons go start1, start2, trackball, p1 button2, p1 button1, following the above layout.  So the start buttons are also action buttons, and the action buttons are start buttons, but they are 4 different buttons, even though there are two different actions.

miscDetails=This game is unplayable on anyone's layout.  It used a series of photo sensors and a punching pad, along with boxing gloves to make a 'punching sim'.  Mame maps the impact position on the pad to the directional arrows and the speed is calculated by the photo sensors.  Player 2 joystick may also do something.  It doesn't really matter as the game is unplayable.  Interesting side note....  The original machine was responsible for several lawsuits as the pad wasn't padded enough and people injured themselves hitting it.

Mame has a hack so you can play with 8-way joyaticks, but the original had trackballs; mame also has the trackballs, but since no keys are mapped to the TBs (to enable the joystick hack), the TBs don't show in the tab input menu.  There apparently were joystick bootlegs of this game; mame only has one version, so the bootlegs might have been hardware hacks no just the inputs (or mame is missing the different ROMs).

miscDetails=The distinction of left and right on these labels isn't which limb you use, but describes the position of the buttons on the control panel.  Each player has two arm and leg buttons and they both do different things, even though they are labeld different.  On the original control panel the arm buttons are on the top row and the legs are on the bottom with the head button centered, above both rows.  So to play this game properly, some remapping will probably be required.

The 4-way mode was useful for the Tanks stage, and necessary for the Light Cycle stage.  Controls worked as follows: Light Cycles: The joystick controls the direction of travel and the trigger controls the speed of the bike. Grid Bugs: The stick controls the movement of your character and the spinner controls the direction of fire. Tanks: The stick controls the movement of your tank and the spinner controls the direction of fire. MCP Cone: The stick controls the movement of your character and the spinner controls the direction of fire.

The plunger appears to be digital, but since it really adds to the feel of the game, I tacked on the 'other' flag.  The hardcoded defaults for the flippers are left ctrl and right ctrl. It is suggested that you place a videopin.ini in your personal ctrlr folder and remap them to match visual pinball defaults.

miscDetails=There are two button on each stick (trigger and thumb buttons).  The thumb buttons are to rotate the tanks' turrent if you bought the ability to rotate (and it's not damaged).  The right trigger is the normal fire button, the left trigger button is to fire the special weapon.  If you have different types of special weapons, the start is used to switch between the different types.  The odd numbered buttons are the triggers and the even numbered ones are the thumb switches for the left and right joysticks respectively.  Note:  If you have cheats enabled the game inputs are hacked to use a 4way joystick as the controls. There isn't an option to turn it off in the cheat menu, so if you wish to play the game correctly, turn cheats off.

miscDetails=The trackball moves the player.  There are two 4-way joysticks, one one each side of the trackball, but they are both wired to the same input.  Mame maps both sticks to the left stick of a dual stick combo to avoid the conflicting default keyboard mapping of the normal joystick and the trackball; mame's right stick input type is not used.  (Note for HowardC:  Accepted for now, but I'll try to get the mame devs to accept a fixed one.  Remapping to avoid conflict is silly as almost everyone maps the 'left joystick' to match their regular joystick. Now if it was mapped to joystick right then I could have seen it.)  Keep an eye on this game for driver changes.

The aim button is shown with two physical buttons wired to one pin in the schematics.  All buttons are on one input port in the machine; mame puts them all as player 1 inputs, but on the 2 player game, the aim button(s) is more like a player 2 button.  (On a one player game, all inputs are like player 1 inputs.)
